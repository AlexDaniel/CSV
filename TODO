  Once Regexes are "fast" again, and $!eol can be embedded in $chx,
  re-enable the ~~ $eol again. For now disable the use of Regex in
  eol attribute.

   new (eol => Str,                     # supported
   new (eol => "\n",                    # supported
   new (eol => "\r\n",                  # supported
   new (eol => rx{ \s* \r?\n },         # future
